/**
 * Choosing every voicing in a song at once (docs/DESIGN.md §2.10).
 *
 * Picking shapes one chord at a time is the right way to make a decision and
 * the wrong way to make thirty of them. What a player actually wants is a
 * policy — keep it in one position, keep it open, or play the part a particular
 * idiom asks for — applied across the whole chart, with the hand's path through
 * the song taken into account rather than each chord judged alone.
 *
 * A planner is *one* function. It is handed the whole song, already read
 * (`core/song-analysis.js`), and gives back a shape per chord occurrence. It is
 * not handed one chord at a time, and there is deliberately no second, easier
 * API for the planners that would be happy with that: a shared walk taking a
 * candidate function and a cost function is the design we rejected, and leaving
 * it available would leave the wrong shape as the easy road. What is shared is
 * utilities — `./candidates.js` and `./shape.js` — which a planner calls or
 * ignores as it likes. The price is that each planner writes its own loop.
 *
 * Nothing here writes text. A plan is a map from occurrence to frets, and the
 * caller applies it with `./apply.js` (`applyPlan` / `planIntoNewVariation`),
 * which maps the plan onto cifra.md's §8.5.4 `chooseShapes` and §8.5.5
 * `addVariation`, so a wizard is reviewable before it is accepted and undoable
 * afterwards by the ordinary means.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous, like everything in core/ (§3.2).
